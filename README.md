# SARS-CoV2_ONT_data
This repository contains the scripts that were used in Tomb√°cz et al. 2022. High Temporal-Resolution Nanopore Sequencing Dataset of  SARS-CoV-2 and Host Cell RNAs.

The sequences can be found at:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB51064

The original *.bam* files (inital mapping) can be downloaded with the *PRJEB51064_SARS-CoV2_pass.download.sh* script, \
then the *fastqfrombam.sh* script generates the *.fastq* files containging the viral reads, which, in turn can mapped using the *minimap.sh* executable.

Alternatively, *.fastq* files can be downloaded from the ENA and mapped using *minimap.sh*

The *gigasci.worklfow.R* contains the analysis of the reads, carried out in four steps: \
1.) Import the *.bam* files (itt will rename them to match the *sample_name* column in the "metadata.tsv" file) \
2.) Clustering the alignments into unique alignments, i.e. *Transcripts* \
3.) Detection of "Leaders" and "Trailers"; Differentiating betweem *genomic* and *sub-genomic RNAs* \
4.) Summing and statistics

The worklofw will save the anaylsis into an .RData image, which will be loaded by the *giga.plots.R* script, which will then generate the plots.

The *gigasci.worklfow.R* file can be sourced, which will carry out the whole analyis. For each step and parameter there are comments to make the code understandable.
minimap2 is has to be in the path for the mapping part, and the required R packages must be installed before the scirpts can be run, obviously.
